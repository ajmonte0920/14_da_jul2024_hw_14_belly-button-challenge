HW 14 (Interactive Visualizations) for Data Science Bootcamp

For this assignement we were tasked with creating an interactive dashboard to explore the provide "Belly Button Biodiversity" dataset. This was completed by creating a code that fetches data from a JSON file, populates a dropdown menu with sample names, and displays charts and metadata based on the sample. The viualizations are rendered dynamically through Plotly and the dashboard is made to upate when a new sample is selected.
